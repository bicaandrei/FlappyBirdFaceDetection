# FlappyBirdFaceDetection

## Introduction

FlappyBirdFaceDetection is a recreation of the classic game Flappy Bird with a unique twist - it is controlled by facial movements detected using OpenCV's trained models for face and nose detection. Instead of tapping the screen or pressing keys, players navigate the bird through obstacles by moving their face up and down.

This project is written in Python and utilizes OpenCV for real-time image processing and facial feature detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bicaandrei/FlappyBirdFaceDetection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd FlappyBirdFaceDetection
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Position your face in front of the camera and move it up and down to control the bird's altitude.

3. Navigate the bird through the obstacles by adjusting your facial movements.

4. The game ends if the bird collides with an obstacle or goes out of bounds.

5. Press 'Q' to quit the game.
